# Concepts: Overview of Redux & Sagas with React

This guide is meant as an introduction to the concepts of Redux (with Sagas). We'll start with the big picture and slowly work our
way down to actual code in a boiler plate project that fetches and displays a list of users.

## 10,000 Foot View

From way up high, we have React components that render data that has been fetched with Sagas and stored in a Redux store (see diagram below).
When data changes on the backend or when a user interacts with the UI, the data rendered with React must change. To keep data changes in-sync
across the application, we use a sigle source of truth, Redux. It acts as a data store, a snapshot of the application state at a point in time.

Components subscribe to portions of the store, allowing them to listen in on changes to the data they care about. When a user changes data
(ex. updating an email address), the component will send a message to the store to inform it of the change. The message will first pass through the Saga
middleware. If it requires an asynchronous event (side-effect) like making an HTTP call, a Saga will run and when it resolves pass a different message along
to the store, otherwise the original message just passes through.

Based on the type of message being passed, the Redux store will accordingly update the application state. These data changes will then be pushed out to
all components interested in the updated portion of the store. React will render components with the new state and the cycle is complete.

## 1,000 Foot View

Below the clouds, we can begin to make out the flutter of messages passing from components. When a component's data changes, it uses Redux's `dispatch` method to pass a plain JavaScript object (bottom left of diagram).
The object may contain two things: the 'type' of message (action) and maybe a payload (e.g. an updated email address).

The action will pass into the middleware (bottom right of diagram). The middleware is listening for particular types of actions: ones that require some asynchronous code to run. When the middleware finds one, it passes the message to
the relevant Saga, a [generator function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*), which exectues the async code (ex. makes a fetch request), pauses until it resolves (gets a response from a server), and then finishes running the code (parsing or transformations). Then, it will create and pass along another action to the store. If the original action was not being listened for by the middleware, it simply passes through unaltered.

Once the action reaches the store, a `reducer` is listening for certain types of actions (top right of diagram). The action type will determine how the reducer updates the state held in the store. It does so immutably and with pure functions: by returning a new state object when an update occurs, instead of mutating the current data, and with functions that do not have any side-effects (async code). These changes are then pushed out (published) to any component that is listening (subscribed) to the data in the store.

Similar to React's [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), Redux has a `<Provider>` component that wraps your `<App>` and allows it to inject data at any layer of the component tree (left side of diagram). A component listens to a portion of the store by wrapping itself in Redux's `connect` method: a higher-order component (HOC) that will pass the store data down to your component as regular old `props` (defined in your component as `mapStateToProps`). When the store data changes, the updated props will trigger the component to re-render with the new state. The connect component will also pass `dispatch` methods for the component to fire off actions (defined in your component as `mapDispatchToProps`). When the UI state changes, a new action can be dispatched and the cycle begins again.

**Note:** I have the `connect` component under the React section. It is part of the Redux package but under the hood is just a React component, albeit a custom higher-order component.

## Sea Level View

Let's walk through step-by-step how a data change cycle works, starting with the `<UserList>` component. When the component mounts after being initialized, it runs the `componentDidMount` lifecycle method:

```javascript
UserList.js;

componentDidMount() {
  this.props.getUsers();
}
```

`getUsers()` is a prop passed by Redux's `connect` HOC to our component. It is just a wrapper for Redux's `dispatch` method which handles passing to the store messages (actions). We can define what `dispatch` methods we want passed inside `mapDispatchToProps` and pass it as an argument to `connect`.

```javascript
UserList.js;

const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => ({
  getUsers: () => dispatch(fetchUsers())
});

export default connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(UserList);
```

`getUsers()` will fire an action to the Redux store to signal an update in state. Here, you could define and pass a plain JS object to `dispatch`, but we are using an action creator: a function that returns an action. This allows us to keep our code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) by referencing a single function rather than continually typing out the same object each time.

```javascript
actions.js;

export const fetchUsers = () => ({
  type: FETCH_USERS
});
```

Actions must include at least a `type` property, a string to identify it. We could define the type here but we are using a constant `FETCH_USERS` imported from a constants file. This allows us to avoid typo bugs and easy reference/look up of action types since they will all exist in a single file.

```javascript
actionsTypes.js;

export const FETCH_USERS = 'FETCH_USERS';
```

Since we have Redux set up to use sagas, our action will pass through our middleware before reaching the store. Think of middleware as software that runs between (in the middle of) other code, injecting some additional functionality or spinning off other processes based on the passing code (e.g. request/response handling of HTTP calls in an API). We have a 'watchUser' saga that listens for (`takesEvery`) `FETCH_USERS` action type:

```javascript
userSaga.js;

export default function* watchUser() {
  yield all([takeEvery(FETCH_USERS, fetchUsers)]);
}
```

It will then trigger the `fetchUsers` function which tries to get the list of users from our API. Notice the saga makes use of a generator function (`function*`), which allows our async code to execute, pause (`yield`) while we wait for a response, and then continue. This has the benefit of not blocking other code from running during this time like a separate thread just for side effects.

```javascript
userSaga.js;

function* fetchUsers() {
  // tries to fetch users
  try {
    // calls API for users list
    const response = yield fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users');

    // converts json to JS object
    const users = yield response.json();

    /* other code we'll come back to here */

    // if API call or converting json object fails
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('Oops, something went wrong!');
  }
}
```

While our fetch request is being handled somewhere on some backend, the `FETCH_USERS` action has passed through the middleware and reached our reducer. The reducer function takes in two arguments: the current state of the store (or initial state when the application first loads) and an incoming action. Based on the action type, the reducer will immutably update and return a new application state. For `FETCH_USERS`, our reducer will return a new state object with the `loading` property set to `true`.

```javascript
userReducer.js;

export default function(state = initialState, action) {
  // switch based on actionTypes
  switch (action.type) {
    // when call is made to fetch users
    case FETCH_USERS: {
      return {
        // spread the previous state properties, then overwrite with any updates
        ...state,
        loading: true
      };
    }
    /* other code we'll come back to here */

    // if type doesn't match any case, return previous state
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

Updating the store will trigger Redux to push out the new state to any components listening (subscribed) to the store. These updates propagated through Redux's `<Provider>` to `<Connect>` which in turn pass the updates as props to your components that are wrapped with a `connect` HOC. We can define which portions of the application state we are interested in with `mapStateToProps` and pass it as an arguement to `connect`.

```javascript
UserList.js;

const mapStateToProps = state => ({
  loading: state.users.loading,
  users: state.users.users
});

export default connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(UserList);
```

We can then access these props just like we would if passed from any other parent component. In `<UserList>`, we are listening for the `loading` property of the store to determine if we should show a spinner or not. When loading is updated to true, it will cause new props to be passed and the component to re-render showing a `<Spinner>`.

```javascript
UserList.js;

render() {
    const { loading, users } = this.props;

    // creates a user card for each item in users
    const userList = users.map(user => (
      <User email={user.email} key={user.id} name={user.name} />
    ));

    // displays spinner if loading, user cards otherwise
    return loading ? <Spinner /> : userList;
  }
```

Let's check back in on our fetch call in the user saga. Assuming users are successful returned, we then dispatch (`put`) a new action, `fetchUsersSuccess(users)`.

```javascript
userSaga.js;

function* fetchUsers() {
  try {
    /* API call here */

    // dipatches FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS action
    yield put(fetchUsersSuccess(users));

  /* error block here */
}
```

`fetchUsersSuccess(users)` is another action creator that takes an argument, the users list returned by the fetch request, and returns a `FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS` type action.

```javascript
actions.js;

export const fetchUsersSuccess = users => ({
  type: FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS,
  users
});

actionTypes.js;

export const FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS = 'FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS';
```

The action will pass to the store and be handled in the `FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS` case: it updates the store with a new state, setting the loading property to false and adding an array of users.

```javascript
userReducer.js;

export default function(state = initialState, action) {
  // switch based on actionTypes
  switch (action.type) {
    /* FETCH_USERS case here */

    // when call to fetch user is successful
    case FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS: {
      return {
        ...state,
        loading: false,
        users: action.users
      };
    }
    // if type doesn't match any case, return previous state
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

Again, Redux will push updates out to interested components. Our `<UserList>` will recieve new props for `loading` and `users` from the `connect` HOC and trigger a re-render of the component, displaying our users.

```javascript
UserList.js;

render() {
  const { loading, users } = this.props;

  // creates a user card for each item in users
  const userList = users.map(user => (
    <User email={user.email} key={user.id} name={user.name} />
  ));

  // displays spinner if loading, user cards otherwise
  return loading ? <Spinner /> : userList;
}
```

Now the data change cycle is complete and our UI accurately reflects the state of our application.
